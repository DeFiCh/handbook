# Run a Local Node in Changi

### Get the binaries

Go to the [official DeFiChain release section](https://github.com/DeFiCh/ain/releases) and look for the latest version of the node.

Then click on the Assets dropdown at the end of each release section. Then select the binaries for your Operating System.

Once you have downloaded the binaries extract them to your desired directory. You should see three files inside the bin folder:

- `defid`: DeFiChain node
- `defi-cli`: Command line interface to interact with the node
- `defi-tx`: utility tool to build and sign transactions on DeFiChain

For the purpose of this guide we will only be using defid and defi-cli.

### Runing the node

To run the node just run the `defid` binary with the `-changi` flag

```bash
defid -changi
```

> If you want `defid` to run as a deamon (in the background) add the `-daemon` flag to the command above. Also if you want to have additional debug information about the EVM add `RUST_LOG=debug` to the begining of the command.
>
> `RUST_LOG=debug defid -changi --daemon`

Once the node is running it should start syncing. The process of syncing can take up to a couple of hours depending on your machine so just be patient.

To check if the node is synced you can open a new terminal, run the following command and check if the fields `blocks` and `headers` are equal:

```bash
defi-cli getblockchaininfo | head
```

### Connect Metamask.

To connect to MetaMask the process is the same as the one described in [Connect Metamask to Floppynet](./guide_floppynet_short.md) and in [point 4](./guide_floppynet_short.md#4-fill-network-form-with-connection-data) use the Changi Testnet connection data below. For now only the Chain ID and the optional block explorer in the Changi Testnet are different:

| Network | RPC URL | Chain ID | Block Explorer |
|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
|Changi Testnet| http://changi.dfi.team| 1133 | https://meta.defiscan.live |
