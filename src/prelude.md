  - Guides: A guide on how the features can be used from a user perspective.
    - User: How to interact and use the node as a regular user.
    - Developer: How to interact on a deeper perspective as a developer.
    - Institution: How to interact with the node for exchanges, dealing with updates, best practices etc.
  - References: A to-the-point reference that's used for quick references.
- Standard practices for coding, git, things like how to add a new data structure, add rpc, etc
- Testing: how to write a test and contribute (so we can welcome external contributions too), and release checks
- Links to pink paper, external resources of all kind (a dedicated page similar to github awesome-{x} repos.
- Anything that's doesn't belong in the source code or is process related.

in minutes - not hours.
